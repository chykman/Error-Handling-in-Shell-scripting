# Error-Handling-in-Shell-scripting

## Mini Project Summary

In this mini project, I learned how to create and manage S3 buckets using a Bash script and AWS CLI. I understood the importance of using globally unique bucket names and how to automate bucket creation for different departments. I also practiced checking if a bucket already exists before creating it. This project helped me improve my skills in scripting, AWS services, and troubleshooting errors.
